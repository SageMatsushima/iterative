    <h1>AB Testing</h1>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
        During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that would better help us
        understand AB testing, its applications, and then implementing it into our own websites. We then had to make two
        webpages that differentiated between user interfaces to see the statistical difference between both.
    </p>

    <div class="side">
        <div class="img1">
            <a href="https://stark-brushlands-98888.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">
                <img src="img1.png" class="one" alt="First website" /> </a>
        </div>
        <div class="img2">
            <a href="https://stark-brushlands-98888.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">
                <img src="img2.png" class="two" alt="First website" /> </a>
        </div>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://stark-brushlands-98888.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">The websites link!</a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
        Before I ran my program, I had first make two null and two alternative hypotheses: 1. Time to
        Completion, and <br>2. Return Rate. <br> <br>
    <h4>Null</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>There is no difference between the two websites in the time that it takes to complete a task</li>
        <li>There is no difference between the two websites in return rates back to the home screen</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Alternative</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Website A will have a faster time to completion than website B because it is more minimalistic and there are
            less distractions in the way of the user</li>
        <li>Users will return to website B more often than website A because of its aesthetic purposes and layout</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
        First, I created two different interfaces that varied in presentation but had an interface close enough to
        compare to each other. Then, 25 classmates acted as users and randomly accessed either design A or B. Their task
        was to purchase $150 worth of cacti and to checkout. The user information was then recorded and stored.
    </p>


    <h2>Infographic</h2>
    <div class="info">
        <img src="info.png" class="graphic" alt="Infographic" />
    </div>
    <p>
        After calculating the T and Chi Squared values, using both p values, it statistically determined that the
        hypothesis is insignificant. This means that there is doubt that the alternative hypotheses will repeat itself
        in other trials. As a result, the null might be correct since there isn't enough poof that the alternate
        hypotheses are true.
    </p>

    <h2 class="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="ending">
        Although the the results reflected in this project are from statistics of 25 users, this sample space was
        limited to my fellow students and had a limit to the amount of people able to access the webpages. The results
        of this project shows how AB testing helps developers gain a better insight on their own designs from real
        user's data. Sometimes it is better to make your website more accessible than interactive. Clearer and
        straightforward minimalistic designs help users navigate quicker and simple aesthetics make them want to come
        back.
